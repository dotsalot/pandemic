# Online Pandemic

Can you and your friends save the world?
Based on the popular board game, Online Pandemic is a cooperative game for four players. As members of an elite disease control team, you must keep four deadly diseases at bay. Work together as you travel the globe to treat infections while collecting the cards you need to discover a cure for each disease. But the clock is ticking as outbreaks and epidemics fuel the spreading plagues. As a cooperative game, players win or lose together. Only by working together can you keep the outbreaks in check and find the cures in time!

## How To Play

Go to <http://onlinepandemicgame.herokuapp.com> and sign up. Create a room, have some friends join, start the game and deal out cards.

### Deviations from the standard board game

This online version of Pandemic does not include roles or event cards. To compensate, everyone is a scientist (only need four cards of a color to discover the cure), and there are only four epidemic cards. You can read the instruction and help menus in game for more details.
